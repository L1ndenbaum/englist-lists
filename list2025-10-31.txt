[Paragraph]
In a high-stake negotiation with its longtime adversary, the government agreed to undertake a new round of talks that would seek a comprehensive settlement rather than another temporary compromise. Analysts presumed both sides had reached an inflection point—a moment where continued hostility would no longer be viable, and diplomacy was the only path forward.

Still, military planners warned that easing defenses too quickly could weaken their deterrent power. The negotiators, aware of this tension, vowed not to deviate from the principle of security first. The lead diplomat even inflected her speech with careful optimism, reminding everyone that progress doesn’t come from victory over an enemy but from recognizing when the battlefield must become a conference table.
