[Paragraph]
The aging navy was prone to mechanical failures, a current reminder of what happens when a country neglects its fleet for decades. Commanders refused to relent, insisting that modernization would foster both safety and legitimatic authority on the seas—especially now that pirate attacks were rising again. Engineers explained that the old radar system, an analog relic, had become nearly obsolete, and the crew’s dangerous reliance on improvised fixes was unsustainable.

The proposed overhaul would comprise new digital sensors, reinforced hull plating, and repairs to the sunken docks where half-abandoned vessels rusted quietly. Politicians complained that the plan sounded like a cliché—another grand promise of renewal—but sailors knew it wasn’t rhetoric. It was the difference between drifting blind and finally navigating with purpose.
