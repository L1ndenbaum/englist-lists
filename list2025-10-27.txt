[Paragraph]
To avert a ruinous trade war, the president decided to deliver an address not online but in-person, hoping that direct diplomacy could ease the rising friction between the two nations. His stance was firm yet conciliatory—he called for a truce and proposed preliminary talks to pave the way for peace. Still, some advisers warned that the rival’s escalatory rhetoric might force them to ramp up defenses instead.

Economists noted that a substantial part of the crisis stemmed from one corporation’s monopoly over vital resources. To stabilize markets, the government announced a deferral of new tariffs and introduced a slate of reforms aimed at fair competition. Whether these efforts would truly avert further conflict remained uncertain, but at least they marked a small step away from the brink—and toward reason.
