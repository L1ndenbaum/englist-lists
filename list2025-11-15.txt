[Paragraph]
The scholar was compelled to address the controversy when a journalist pointed out a striking resemblance between two constitutional proposals that were supposed to be independently drafted. The university, known for its prestigious law department, feared the incident might irritate donors, yet the professor’s explanation was oddly compelling: both proposals drew from the same passages of the Constitution, so similarities were feasible, even inevitable.

Critics continued to speculate, but the committee chose to consolidate the drafts rather than confine themselves to partisan suspicion. They aimed for parity between political factions, giving each one equal weight in shaping the final text. Nonetheless, the most prominent members warned that balance alone would not save the project—real integrity came from admitting flaws and fixing them before they hardened into law.
