[Paragraph]
After years of sanctions and distrust, the two nations agreed to trim their military budgets and curb illicit arms trade as part of a fragile pact aimed at restoring peace. Diplomats described the move as a cautious step toward détente, though both sides showed ambivalence—each fearing that any concession might weaken their standing. Critics warned that the ruling party still maintained a stranglehold on negotiations, using delay tactics and bureaucratic deferral to stall progress.

When the pact finally expired, neither side celebrated. The hopes of reconciliation had been quietly smothered by hesitation and half-measures. Yet even failure left a lesson: peace doesn’t collapse in a single moment—it erodes when fear trims away courage.
